This is a workout app that allows you to build your own workout. There are existing exercises to choose from and the user can add their own.

Ideally there will also be pre-built workouts that others can save/ vote on.

Each exercise eventually will have its own description and image linked to it. 

The edit workout page still needs to have a 'remove' function and the ability to edit the title of the workout. 

For the "Create exerise" page, I still want to add an area to upload or link an image that will append on the workout page.

When creating an excerise, I want to add a quick pop-up to show 'exerise added'. 

I want to add a rating system for workouts that other users can vote on based on level of intensity and how much they liked it. I also want to add a way to moderate new exerises added, as these go into the main database at the moment. 

I want to add a random workout generator that randomizes based on muslce type chosen and how many exercises you want to do.

Problems that weren't fixed yet:
-I was going to add a show/hide ability for the descriptions on the main page. Bootstrap had other plans so that does not work yet. :) 





///////User story:

The idea is to be able to build a workout from a list of available exercises, plus add your own exercises. I currently do this in the simple Notes app on my phone and find other work out apps a bit complicated. This should be simple and easy to use. Eventually, it would have ratings on workouts/ exercises. This way users can choose workouts based on ratings of intensity/ other metrics.
