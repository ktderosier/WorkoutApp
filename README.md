This is a workout app that allows you to build your own workout. There are existing exercises to choose from and the user can add their own.



////////Features to add:
-Random workout generator that randomizes based on muslce type chosen and how many exercises you want to do.

-Auto order workouts alphabetically/ by rating

-Add a rating system for workouts that other users can vote on based on level of intensity and how much they liked it. I also want to add a way to moderate new exerises added, as these go into the main database at the moment. 

-When creating an excerise, add a quick pop-up to show 'exerise added'. 

-For the "Create exerise" page, add an area to upload or link an image that will append on the workout page.

-Workout page also needs to ability to delete exercises, edit the title, and delete the entire workout.

-Edit workout page still needs to have a 'remove' function and the ability to edit the title of the workout. 

-Each exercise eventually will have its own description and image linked to it. 

-Add pre-built workouts that others can save/ vote on.



Problems that weren't fixed yet/ that I ran into:
-I was going to add a show/hide ability for the descriptions on the main page. Bootstrap had other plans so that does not work yet. :) 
-LOTS of conflicting CSS with using Bootstrap.





///////User story:

The idea is to be able to build a workout from a list of available exercises, plus add your own exercises. I currently do this in the simple Notes app on my phone and find other work out apps a bit complicated. This should be simple and easy to use. Eventually, it would have ratings on workouts/ exercises. This way users can choose workouts based on ratings of intensity/ other metrics.
